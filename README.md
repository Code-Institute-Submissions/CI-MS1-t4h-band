## Features

A responsive single-page website, with header and footer fixed featuring the band's logo, the navigation bar and social media links. 
The homepage aims to be effective in identifying which Metallica cover the website is about by picturing its logo on the left top and hero images of the band besides next tour dates.
To get the bonding with the fans even stronger, each feature is introduced by a subtitle based on lyrics of iconical Metallica songs. 

Roboto was the font used and the color scale black colors contrasting with yellow tones of the logo:
* fonts: #fff;
* background color: #222225;
* footer icons: #bb9126, (hover): #d35e2c;

### Existing Features

- FIXED HEADER: the logo in the left corner allows visitors to easily recognise the band. By clicking on it, visitors can return to the top of the page. A navbar anchors the sections. 
- FIXED FOOTER: well-known icons direct to the band's social media channels. They are easy enough to find while don't interfere in the experience.
- HOME: a striking image of the band performing welcomes the visitor and is overlaid by a shortlist of upcoming dates, with links to buy tickets and share the event on social media. The mobile version is simplified for a better experience, but in both cases, a "view more" button leads to the Tour Dates section. As in every section, the title is inspired by Metallica hits to get visitors in the mood.
- TOUR: here visitors can see a full list of upcoming dates, sided by hero images of gigs. It includes links to buy tickets, share the event on social media and include them in a calendar. Listing tour dates can also be a good strategy to attract potential clients, so a link invites producers to get in touch and redirects them to the contact page.
- GALLERY: "on the road" section has an auto-scrolling carousel of pictures (by Bootstrap), allowing fans and concert producers to see more of the band on and off stage.
- ABOUT: for those interested in knowing more about the band's story and its members, "reason for being" section bears more room for text, pairing with related images.
- MERCH:  "the memory remains" section informs the fans about promotional band's t-shirts sold in venues stands through an image gallery.
- CONTACT: a simple form, with some basic information required, seamlessly gets concert producers in touch with the band's manager to ask for a quote.

### Features Left to Implement

- Form submission button needs to be functional (once Javascript modules is completed).
- REVIEWS - A section where fans can submit their impressions of some concert or get in touch with the band members.
- An update of GALLERY section embeding the band's Youtube channel.
